Project Description: AI Email Rewriter

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages Cohere's large language models to rewrite and enhance emails. The main features and structure are as follows:

Features:
- Users can input their original email and select a desired tone (Professional, Friendly, Persuasive, Apologetic).
- The app rewrites the email using Cohere's AI models, improving clarity, professionalism, and politeness while maintaining the original message.
- Users can select from available Cohere models (e.g., command, command-light) and provide their Cohere API key securely.
- Optionally, the app can show a visual diff highlighting changes between the original and rewritten email.
- The app supports environment variable fallback for API keys via a .env file.

Key Files:
- app.py: The main Streamlit app, handling UI, user input, and integration with the backend.
- email_rewriter.py: Contains the EmailRewriter class, which interacts with the Cohere API to rewrite emails based on user configuration.
- api_model_checker.py: Checks and lists available Cohere models for the user to select.
- .env: Stores API keys securely for different providers (Cohere, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).

How it Works:
1. User enters their Cohere API key and email text in the sidebar.
2. User selects the desired tone and Cohere model.
3. On clicking 'Rewrite Email', the app sends the request to Cohere's API and displays the rewritten email.
4. Optionally, the user can view a diff of changes between the original and rewritten email.

This tool is designed to help users quickly enhance the tone and clarity of their emails using state-of-the-art AI models, with a focus on privacy and ease of use.
